            As a youth he read and used his imagination to travel and experience other places. Martin wrote and sold monster stories for pennies to other neighborhood children. He wrote stories about a mythical kingdom populated by his pet turtles; the turtles died frequently in their toy castle, so he decided they were killing each other off in "sinister plots".

            In his teens he became interested by Marvel Comics, he later stated; "Maybe Stan Lee is the greatest literary influence on me, even more than Shakespeare or Tolkien."
            Martin joined the comics fandom of the era, writing fiction for various fanzines; he bought the first ticket to the world's first Comic-Con, held in New York in 1964. In 1965, Martin won comic fandom's Alley Award for Best Fan Fiction for his superhero story "Powerman vs. The Blue Barrier".

            In 1970, Martin earned a B.S. in journalism from Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism in Evanston, Illinois, graduating summa cum laude; he went on to complete his M.S. in Journalism in 1971, also from Medill. In the mid-1970s, Martin met English professor George Guthridge from Dubuque, Iowa, at a science fiction convention in Milwaukee. Guthridge helped Martin in finding a job at Clarke University (Clarke College). Martin "wasn't making enough money to stay alive" from writing says Guthridge. From 1976 to 1978, Martin was an English and journalism instructor at Clarke, and he became Writer In Residence at the college from 1978 to 1979.

            Martin is a member of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA); he served as the organization's Southwest Regional Director from 1977 to 1979, and as its vice-president from 1996 to 1998. In 1976, for Kansas City's MidAmeriCon, the 34th World Science Fiction Convention (Worldcon), Martin and his friend and fellow writer-editor Gardner Dozois conceived of and organized the first Hugo Losers' Party for the benefit of all past and present Hugo-losing writers on the evening following the convention's Hugo Awards ceremony. Martin was nominated for two Hugos that year but lost both awards, for the novelette "<i>...and Seven Times Never Kill Man</i>" and the novella <i>The Storms of Windhaven</i>, co-written with Lisa Tuttle. A number of Martin's earlier works are science fiction tales occurring in a loosely defined future history, known informally as "The Thousand Worlds" or "The Manrealm".

            Martin started writing science fiction-horror hybrids in the late 1970s to disprove a critic claiming that science fiction and horror were opposites and incompatible. Martin considered <i>Sandkings</i> (1979) the best known of these. Another was the novella <i>Nightflyers</i> (1980), whose screen and television rights were purchased by Vista, which produced a 1987 film adaptation, Nightflyers, while not a hit at theatres, Martin believes that the film saved his career, and that everything he has written since exists in large part because of it.
            Martin published a vampire novel titled <i>Fevre Dream</i> (1982) set in the 19th century on the Mississippi River. Critic Don D'Amassa wrote: "This is without question one of the greatest vampire novels of all time". Martin followed up Fevre Dream with another horror novel, <i>The Armageddon Rag</i> (1983). The unexpected commercial failure of The Armageddon Rag "essentially destroyed my career as a novelist at the time", he recalled, and made him consider going into real estate instead.
